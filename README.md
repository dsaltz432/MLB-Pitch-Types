# Clustering Pitcher Types to Better Predict Batter Outcomes


## Summary
The main analysis for this project is located within the jupyter notebook. As a prerequisite to running the notebook,
I downloaded mlb-gameday data and web scraped BrooksBaseball data. Both of these steps can be replicated using 
driver.py and  download_mlb_gameday.R.
